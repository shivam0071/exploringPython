A Flask application is an instance of the Flask class. Everything about the application, 
such as configuration and URLs, will be registered with this class.

Instead of creating a Flask instance globally, you will create it inside a function. 
This function is known as the application factory. Any configuration, registration, 
and other setup the application needs will happen inside the function, then the application will be returned.


We can run the application using
> set FLASK_APP=flaskr
> set FLASK_ENV=development
> flask run

the create_app code is in __init__.py 

1.) __init__.py
2.) db.py
3.) schema.sql


g is a special object that is unique for each request. 
It is used to store data that might be accessed by multiple functions during the request. 
The connection is stored and reused instead of creating a new connection 
if get_db is called a second time in the same request.

current_app is another special object that points to the Flask application handling the request. 
Since you used an application factory, there is no application object when writing the rest of your code. 
get_db will be called when the application has been created and is handling a request, 
so current_app can be used.


flask init-db
There will now be a flaskr.sqlite file in the instance folder in your project.
