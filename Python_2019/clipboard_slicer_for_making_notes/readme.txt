There are times when you are studying something and making some notes online/in a
text file,
So when you copy the text from the internet it may happen that the copied line
is too long
For example:-

So now you manually have to press the enter key and make it look nice...right?

So you can just use this program which automatically does that for you in the clipboard
itself and you can make notes quickly :)
