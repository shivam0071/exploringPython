METACHARACTERS

1. ^ (caret) - start of the line
2. $ (dollar) - end of the line

Tip :
It's best to get into the habit of interpreting regular expressions in a rather literal
way. For example, don't think
^cat" matches a line with cat at the beginning
but rather:
^cat" matches if you have the beginning of a line, followed immediately
by c, followed immediately by a, followed immediately by t.
They both end up meaning the same thing, but reading it the more literal way
allows you to intrinsically understand a new expression when you see it.

3. Character Class
[...] - character class, lets you list the characters you want to allow at
that point in the match

Tip : While e" matches just an e, and a" matches just an a, the regular expression [ea]" matches
either. So, then, consider gr[ea]y": this means to find g, followed by r, followed
by either an e or an a, all followed by y .
The contents of a class is a list of characters that can match at that point,
so the implication is or

eg - <H[123456]>", which matches <H1>, <H2>, <H3> etc

    (3.a) Character class metacharacter ->  - (Dash) (Note that a dash is a metacharacter only
    within a character class  otherwise it matches the normal dash character.)

    (dash) indicates a range of characters: !<H[1-6]>" is identical to the previous
    example. [0-9]"

    more examples - [a-z], [a-zA-z], [0-9a-fA-F] and [A-Fa-f0-9] are same as order doesn't matter
    [0-9A-ZR!.?] matches a digit, uppercase letter, underscore, exclamation
    point, period, or a question mark.



THINGS so FAR
^cat$ --> Literally means: matches if the line has a beginning-of-line (which, of
          course, all lines have), followed immediately by c × a × t, and then followed
          immediately by the end of the line.
      Effectively means: a line that consists of only cat  no extra words,
      spaces, punctuation... just `cat'.

^$ --> Literally means: matches if the line has a beginning-of-line, followed
                      immediately by the end of the line.
                    Effectively means: an empty line (with nothing in it, not even spaces).


^  --> Literally means: matches if the line has a beginning-of-line.
Effectively meaningless! Since every line has a beginning, every line
will matcheven lines that are empty!


    (3.b) [^] (negate)--> the class matches any character that isn't listed
    [^1-6] --> matches a character that's not 1 through 6. The leading ^ in
    the class negates the list, so rather than listing the characters you want to include
    in the class, you list the characters you don't want to be included.

 Note that [^u] means match any character other that "u", So
 something should match (even a space or next line character in th end (\n)


4.)Metacharcter  . (dot) :-
ones that match any character (including the dash, period, and slash that we are expecting).
However, it is important to know that each dot can match any character at all, so it can match,
say, `lottery numbers: 19 203319 7639'.

This is more precise 03[-./]19[-./]76 if we need -./
mostly depends on your knowledge of data being searched


5.) Metacharacter | (OR) :- It allows you to combine
multiple expressions into a single expression that matches any of the individual
ones.

For example, Bob" and Robert" are separate expressions, but Bob|Robert is
one expression that matches either. When combined this way, the subexpressions
are called alternatives.

Note that | is just a character inside [...] so you can't or like gr[a|e]y
instead use gr(a|e)y  OR  grey|gray
the parentheses are required because without them, gra|ey
means gra or ey

Now why do we need or when we have [...]?
Its because with Jeffrey ,Jeffery" we can Jeff[re]y which means search for Jeffey or Jeffry
which is not what we can (here we have 2 characters to match and not just one

So we can or as
Jeffrey|Jeffery
Jeff(rey|ery)
Jeff(re|er)y

So Far :-

Metacharacter           Name                                    Matches
.                       dot                                     any one character
[]                   character class                         any character listed
[^]                  negated character class                 any character not listed
^                      caret                                    the position at the start of the line
$                      dollar                                   the position at the end of the line
\<                      backslash less-than                     the position at the start of a word
\>                      backslash greater-than                  the position at the end of a word
                                                                 (not supported by all versions of egrep)
|                        or; bar                                matches either expression it separates
()                   parentheses                             used to limit scope of !;", plus additional uses

\< \>  use \b in place of them for exact match **

Optional ITEMS

Quantifiers:-

6.) Metacharacter (?) (question mark) :-
The metacharacter ? (question mark) means optional. It is placed after the character that is
allowed to appear at that point in the expression, but whose existence isn't actually
required to still be considered a successful match.

Eg for matching colour and color we can use
colo?ur which matches color or colour
Note that ? is always successful

We can also use ? with a parenthesis now everything in paranthesis
acts as one complete unit -- ()?
eg- in order to match 4th or 4 we can -> 4(th)?


# Other Quantifier s: Repetition (18)

7.) Metacharacter (+) (plus) :-
The metacharacter !+" means one or more of the immediately-preceding item,
it tries to match as many times as possible,
but different in that it fails if it can't match at least once.



8.) Metacharacter (*) (star) :-
* means any number, including none of the item.
try to match it as many times as possible, but it's OK to settle for nothing if need be.

Example:-
any version of this
<HR SIZE=14 >
<HR(space)+SIZE(space)*=(space)*[0-9]+(space)*>",

2.) find <HR> but the SIZE attribute is optional
<HR( +SIZE *= *[1-9]+)? *>
use ?: inside a parenthesis to use it as a subexpression and not as a group
<HR(?: +SIZE *= *[1-9]+)? *>

PAGE 20 Parenthesis and Backreferences

9.)Interval Quantifiers :- {min, max}
For example
{3, 12} -  matches up to 12 times if possible, but settles for three
[a-zA-Z]{1,5} -
{0,1} - Same as question mark


10.) BACK REFERENCING:- Wouldn't it be nice if we could match one generic word, and then say
now match the same thing again?
Backreferencing is a regular-expression feature that allows you to match new
text that is the same as some text matched earlier in the expression.

In order to find the double occurence of a word we can use
\<the +the\> can be replaced by

"\<([A-Za-z]+) +\1\>"

Here \1 is a special meta sequence
the special metasequence !\1" represents
that text later in the regular expression,

SO \1 remebers first sequence matched  - ([A-Za-z]+)

we can heve \2 \3 \4

([a-z])([0-9])\1\2
here
the \1" refers to the text matched by [a-z]", and \2" refers
to the text matched by [0-9].

Paranthesis is important


\ :-
In order to match a metacharacter use backslash to escape it
